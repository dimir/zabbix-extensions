If you want to use Zabbix PHP classes in your module you can generate phpDoc documentation
and get at least some indexed view of those classes and their methods. Keep in mind that
this is work in progress and not everything is described. Here's a way to do that using
Docker container:

    cd /usr/share/zabbix/include/classes/html
    docker run --rm -v ${PWD}:/data phpdoc/phpdoc:3
    mv .phpdoc /var/www/html/phpdoc

and open your browser pointing it to that directory.
