Important! This module should be working on Zabbix 6.4 and later.

This module demonstrates how to create a web page where you want to display hosts/items in a different view. In detail, here you can see how to:

  - add new menu element that will point to the new page
  - display a list in an HTML table, using Zabbix items as an example
  - fetch items of a specific host using Zabbix PHP classes (that use Zabbix API but directly, not over HTTP)
  - use multiselect HTML form element to select specific host from the system
  - use user input to control what to display on the page
