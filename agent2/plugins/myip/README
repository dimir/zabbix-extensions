This is the source code of loadable Zabbix agent 2 plugin Myip. It implements 1 metric
called myip, which returns the external IP address of the host where the agent is
running. In order to build the plugin you need to be connected to the Internet.

Make sure golang and make packages are installed:

    apt install golang make

Build the plugin:

    sudo make install

Configure it in Zabbix agent 2:

    echo Plugins.Myip.System.Path=/usr/local/zabbix/go/plugins/myip | sudo tee /etc/zabbix/zabbix_agent2.d/plugins.d/myip.conf

Test it:

    zabbix_agent2 -t myip

If you face any errors first make sure user zabbix has permissions
to access /usr/local/zabbix/go/plugins/myip directory.
