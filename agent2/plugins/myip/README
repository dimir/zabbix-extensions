This is the source code of loadable Zabbix agent 2 plugin myip. It implements 1 metric
called myip, which returns the external IP address of the host where the agent is running.

In order to build the plugin first make sure the golang package is installed:

    apt install golang

Build the plugin:

    make

Put it to a certain place:

    sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/zabbix/go/plugins
    sudo mv myip /usr/local/zabbix/go/plugins

Configure it in Zabbix agent 2:

    echo Plugins.Myip.System.Path=/usr/local/zabbix/go/plugins/myip | sudo tee /etc/zabbix_agent2.d/plugins.d/myip.conf

Test it:

    zabbix_agent2 -t myip
